# How would you define art?
  How would you define art? What is art? Many people have their own opinoins on what art is and what it should look like. Some people see art as a way to express emotions like love. Some people see art as just to create an image with your own imagination and skills. Actually Art is the process of arranging elements in a way that appeals to ones senses or emotions.
  
  
  One of the primary functions of art is to interpret the subject of matter at hand. Subject matter does not change all that much over time. Although new subject matter has evolved, the human condition, nature, and events still continue to capture the attention of artists. Another, one of the things that art does is extend and expand our shared common visual language. When new visual ideas are first introduced by the artist, they are often seen as shocking, and perhaps even as incomprehensible. However, with time the best and most effective of these ideas are accepted.
  
  To me Art is a way of expressing your feelings, ideas, and life. Art has been in our entire lifes, and we have all experienced it. Remember that time in 1st grade when you had to draw a tree or a car? Well that was a time when you have created art. It all came from your mind, it has part of your life and your feelings. Even though we didnt know about it back then. But as we progress in life we learn new things everyday and art will always be around us.
